      Happy Hour is a sacred, life-changing, dust-ridden dreamland. You will smile more than you ever thought possible, dance until your body physically forces you to stop, and become completely present for eight days. I couldn’t have scripted a more fitting end to last year’s burn than to watch my luggage go up in flames on the road out of the playa. An electrical fire in our RV was temporarily terrifying and at the same time, absolutely perfect. I sifted through my charred belongings and laughed. NYC left me with nothing and everything. As I pack for Burning Man 2016 I thought I would keep a running list of all of the supplies, clothing, accessories, food and other burner gear that I’ll be bringing with me to Black Rock City. If you’re a first-timer I hope this helps you get a head start on what to pack for Burning Man and gets you one step closer to home.</p>

    <p class="content">
      Boots – Perhaps the most essential piece of your playa wardrobe is the right pair of shoes. For women, shoes on the playa range from five-inch tall goth-inspired platforms to running sneakers.  Comfort is key so whatever you decide to wear, make sure you can stand dancing and biking in it for at least 24 hours. I have rocked the same pair of black knee-length wedge boots for the past two years and have been able to dance, bike and walk without ever getting a blister. They have about a 2.5” wedge heel and cost me less than $40. Make sure you don’t bring heeled boots – even a stacked heel. The desert floor will not support your heels and you will sink into the earth when you try to walk.
      Fur coat – You really only need one fur coat but make sure it’s warm. Temperatures drop below freezing at night. Hit your local vintage shops to find the perfect fur for a decent price.
      Bathing suits and leotards – Think of your bikinis as your base layer to which you can build the rest of your costume. I love wearing high-waisted bottoms, lots of straps, bright colors, and black.
      Sunglasses – You’ll wear sunglasses every day, so bring at least a couple of pairs. I prefer ones with side shields to keep dust from getting in.
      Goggles – You may or may not need goggles, depending on the frequency and intensity of dust storms, but definitely have a pair with you just in case. Last year even goggles, a face mask and a scarf couldn’t keep the dust from getting in eyes, nose, ears and mouth. At the very least your goggles will be a fashion accessory, and an easy way to hide the fact that you haven’t slept in two days.
      Tutu – There’s never an inappropriate time to wear a tutu on the playa, especially Tutu Tuesday when the tulle comes out in force, 70,000 strong. My go-to burning man tutu is compliments of my 7th grade dance recital.
      Scarves – You’ll use scarves to protect your face from the sun, the dust, and to keep your playa hair looking fierce.
      Fan – Staying cool is essential to your health and stamina at Burning Man. Bring a pocket fan, maybe two in case you lose one. Getting heat stroke on the playa is a real concern and not one you want to deal with.
      Hip bag – Whether it’s steampunk leather or holographic, a hip bag/shoulder holster will keep your stuff safe and your hands free for dancing…and hugging. Etsy has lots of really cool handmade leather bags.
      Hats – Top hats, blinged-out military hats, mohawks, headbands, turbans, furry animals…they are all fair game for your head. And when temperatures dip at night, you’ll want a plush panda keeping your head warm. Trust me.
      Temporary tattoos – Don’t waste your money on expensive Flash Tattoos. You can get similar metallic tattoos on Amazon for a fraction of the price.
      Lights – Add to the magic of nightfall on the playa by draping yourself in EL wire, glowing glasses, fiberoptic hats. Anything that illuminates. Lights are also a safety essential. If you are not lit, you cannot be seen by art cars and bikers.
      Gloves – Biker gloves (with the fingers cut) are fashionable and functional. Avoid blisters and cracked hands by keeping hands covered.</p>

            <p class='first-content'>Many of you have been asking the who, what and how of my recent trip to Cuba, so I thought I’d put together this travel guide answering the most common questions.  If you are planning to travel to Cuba and have a specific question, leave it in the comments and I’ll do my best to answer it! How can Americans travel to Cuba?  I went to Cuba on a people-to-people program with Cuba Travel Services. <span class="lettercolor">The purpose of a people-to-people trip</span> is to have meaningful interaction with Cuban people. The types of activities vary, from learning how to tobacco farm, to visiting a community center, to meeting a local chef over dinner at a privately-owned restaurant. Most people-to-people schedules are deliberately jam-packed with approved activities so there is very little free time for creative interpretation of the people-to-people parameters. The important thing to note is that travel as a tourist is banned for Americans, and will continue to be banned even after the new U.S. policies take effect. This means recreational activities like lounging on a beach are out. But who wants to be a tourist anyway?  My people-to-people trip was exactly how I like to travel — we were hanging with locals every day, playing Cuban music, dancing Cuban salsa, eating Cuban food, and learning about the Cuban way of life…and <span class="lettercolor">drinking ample mojitos and daiquiris along the way</span>. How do you fly to Cuba from America?  Companies like Cuba Travel Services charter planes to get you to Cuba.  We flew a charted Sun Country flight direct from Miami, but in March 2015 Cuba Travel Services will be operating a direct charter flight out of New York City’s JFK Airport! Round-trip airfare on the inaugural JFK-Havana flight starts at around $849/person.</p>

            <p> How are the hotels in Cuba? I stayed at the Meliá Habana in the Miramar neighborhood, but I also checked out the Meliá Cohiba (lovely), <span class="lettercolor">the Hotel Saratoga (where Beyonce and Jay Z stayed…it’s gorgeous)</span> and the Hotel Nacional De Cuba, which has beautiful grounds and colonial architecture, but I have heard that the rooms are slightly less modern, although I haven’t seen them for myself.  My room at the Meliá Habana was on The Level, a concierge floor with an exclusive lounge, dining room and other upscale amenities.  It had modern fixings, a gorgeous oceanfront terrace, free Wi-Fi and turn-down service that included a surprise bottle of wine and charcuterie plate one night. <span class="lettercolor">Breakfast included fresh guava, pastries, omelets, lox, and exquisite Cuban coffee.</span> There were expansive pools at both the Meliá properties and a cute rooftop boutique-style pool at the Saratoga over-looking El Capitolo.  Most of the hotel lobbies have a looming scent of cigar smoke but there are typically designated smoking sections and you can request a non-smoking guest room, which I recommend. Is there Internet in Cuba?  Most Cubans don’t have Internet but some have access to a government-controlled Intranet.  <span class="lettercolor">While most Cubans have heard of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram many have never used them.</span> Hotels that have frequent business travelers, however, do have Wi-Fi Internet that resembles what we have in the States with a few exceptions — it’s much slower and you are required to re-enter your user and pin every 10-15 minutes. It’s also quite costly to pay-per-hour for Internet so if you find a hotel that includes it in the price of your stay, that’s a bonus. How do I get around Cuba?  Taxis:  The 1950’s Cadillacs, Fords and Pontiacs that give Cuba its nostalgic postcard vibe are actually mostly share taxis.  They act as shuttles, and will take up to five passengers to pre-determined stops.  They always follow the same routes.  You can also hire a private taxi to take you from <span class="lettercolor">place to place.</span></p>
